		<h3>The Different Branches of Accounting</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><b>Financial Accounting</b></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Financial accounting is a specific branch of accounting involving a process of recording, summarizing, and reporting the myriad of transactions resulting from business operations over a period of time. These transactions are summarized in the preparation of financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement, that record the company&apos;s operating performance over a specified period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work opportunities for a financial accountant can be found in both the public and private sectors. A financial accountant&apos;s duties may differ from those of a general accountant, who works for himself or herself rather than directly for a company or organization.</p>

From this, data and estimates emerge. Cost accounting is the process of translating these estimates and data into knowledge that will ultimately be used to guide decision-making.</p>
<p>The main difference between financial and managerial accounting is whether there is an internal or external focus. Financial accounting focuses on creating and evaluating financial statements that will be reported externally, like creditors and investors. In contrast, managerial accounting analyses and results are kept in-house for business leaders to use to drive decision-making and run the company more effectively. Managerial accountants handle many facets of accounting. These include margins, constraints, capital budgeting, trends and forecasting, valuation and product costing.</p>

Other commonly audited areas include: secretarial and compliance, internal controls, quality management, project management, water management, and energy conservation. As a result of an audit, stakeholders may evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance over the subject matter.</p>

    <li>
        <p><b>Service</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A service business is&nbsp;an enterprise composed of a professional or team of experts that deliver work or aid in completing a task for the benefit of its customers. The product a service business delivers isn&apos;t like a product you buy at the store, such as a television, piece of clothing, or food item.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>

This is a key part of the success of these businesses and how they try to differentiate themselves from the competition. This includes the quality of work they perform, how friendly they are, the timeliness of completing their job, and their ability to answer questions or address any problems that may arise. Take a minute and think about a business you like to use or are very loyal to. They probably deliver a great customer service experience.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <p>&nbsp;<b>Trading or Merchandising</b> -&nbsp;Merchandising is the presentation and promotion of goods that are available for purchase for both wholesale and retail sales. This includes marketing strategies, display design, and competitive pricing, including discounting. Merchandising is important for retailers looking to cultivate their brand, improve the experience of customers, compete with others in the sector, and ultimately, drive sales.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>KEY TAKEAWAY</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><b>Merchandising</b> refers to the marketing and sales of products.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Merchandising</b> is most often synonymous with retail sales, where businesses sell products to consumers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Merchandising</b>, more narrowly, may refer to the marketing, promotion, and advertising of products intended for retail sale.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Technology</b> is changing the face of merchandising, with electronic point-of-sale terminals to targeted and personalized mobile ads.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Categories of merchandising</b> include product, visual, retail, digital, and omnichannel.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <p>&nbsp;<b>Manufacturing</b> -&nbsp;A&nbsp;manufacturing business&nbsp;is any business that uses components, parts or raw materials to make a finished good. These finished goods can be sold directly to consumers or to other manufacturing businesses that use them for making a different product. Manufacturing businesses in today&apos;s world are normally comprised of machines, robots, computers, and humans that all work in a specific manner to create a product.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Manufacturing plants often use an&nbsp;assembly line, which is a process where a product is put together in sequence from one work station to the next. By moving the product down an assembly line, the finished good can be put together quicker with less manual labor. It&apos;s important to note that some industries refer to the manufacturing process as&nbsp;fabrication.</p>
<p>Manufacturing businesses can be very simple, with only a few parts required for assembly, or they can be very complicated, with hundreds of parts needed to create a finished product. Compared to other businesses, manufacturing businesses usually have more legal regulations and environmental laws to deal with. These things can range from scrutinized labor laws to environmental and pollution issues. Although labor unions are not as common as they were 50 years ago, they still heavily exist in the manufacturing industry, where wages, benefits, and other rights are negotiated. Let&apos;s take a look at a few examples of manufacturing businesses.</p>
